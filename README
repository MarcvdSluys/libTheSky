The package libTheSky provides a Fortran library to compute the positions and other 
properties of celestial bodies (Moon, planets, comets, asteroids, stars), events (e.g. 
lunar phases) and coordinate transformations. It forms the core of the software that 
is used to create the Dutch popular-astronomy website https://hemel.waarnemen.com.
